# arm9loaderhax for 3DS

## What this is

This is a fork of delebile's A9LH implementation, this exploit is documented [here](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/3DS_System_Flaws) and also presented [in this conference](https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7240-console_hacking), and provides ARM9 code execution directly at boot, exploiting a vulnerability present in the 9.6+ version of the New3DS arm9loader.

It has no screen init and is as minimal as it can be.

The exploit was found by **plutoo** and **yellows8**.

## Usage

It loads an **arm9loaderhax.bin** arm9 payload from the root of the sdcard at address 0x23F00000.

This means that it offers a BRAHMA-like setup, and as such has compatibility with every payload BRAHMA can run; you can also perform a firmlaunch by writing the ARM11 kernel entrypoint at address 0x1FFFFFF8.

## Installation

This fork is specifically designed to work with "Safe A9LH installer".

## Setup

Compilation needs devkitARM r45.
